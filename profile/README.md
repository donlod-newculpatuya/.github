# Cinematic Excellence 🎥

### Directed by Domingo González, Your Fault was developed alongside the third installment, Our Fault (Culpa Nuestra), ensuring narrative cohesion. Produced by Banijay Iberia’s Pokeepsie Films in collaboration with Amazon MGM Studios, the film wrapped shooting in February 2024.

### Cinematography
Carlos Cebrián, Francisco Sánchez Polo
This time, the story has fewer car races and action fight scenes, focusing instead on the drama and trust issues in the relationship. Another great aspect of this story is the subplot about Lion (Victor Varona), who’s embarrassed that his girlfriend Jenna (Eva Ruiz) is rich and he can’t provide for her. This sweet storyline adds excitement and danger to the film due to the path he takes. Your Fault had lots of subtle comedy and occasional humour throughout which I enjoyed. There’s a well-choreographed big fight scene and a fast-paced car race scene that feels like you’re watching Fast and Furious.

### Music and Soundtrack
The film’s music is composed by Vishal Bhardwaj, and the soundtrack is minimalistic, in keeping with the film’s tone. There are no big musical numbers or showy songs, and the music serves more as a tool to heighten the emotional and suspenseful moments. The background score is subtle but effective, building tension at key moments and heightening the film’s suspense.
